I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Aerospace Engineering (AE) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Adviced by Professor Hyochoong Bang, I am expected to receive my Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering at KAIST in 2024. The dissertation title is "A Study on Robust Particle Filtering in Terrain-referenced Navigation." I received my M.S. degree in AE at KAIST in 2018, and B.S. degree in AE at KAIST in 2016. I am interested in SOMETHING. 

My current research focuses on
